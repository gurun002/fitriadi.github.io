          I’m a curious person who learns quickly and loves figuring out faster ways to do things. 
          I get distracted sometimes (and bored just as easily), but that often pushes me to explore 
          new ideas and keep things interesting. I like making life simpler—for myself and for others— 
          mostly because I believe that good design and smart solutions come from a healthy dose of laziness.
